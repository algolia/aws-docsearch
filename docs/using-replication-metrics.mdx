# Using Replication Metrics to Monitor Amazon S3 Replication Configurations<a name="using-replication-metrics"></a>

Each replication rule that has S3 Replication Time Control \(S3 RTC\) enabled publishes replication metrics\. With replication metrics, you can monitor the total number and size of objects that are pending replication, and the maximum replication time to the destination Region\. You can then monitor each dataset that you replicate separately\. 

Replication metrics are available within 15 minutes of enabling S3 RTC\. Replication metrics are available through the [Amazon S3 console](https://console.aws.amazon.com/s3/), the [Amazon S3 API](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/AmazonS3/latest/API/), the [AWS SDKs](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/AmazonS3/latest/dev/UsingAWSSDK.html), the [AWS Command Line Interface \(AWS CLI\)](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/cli/latest/reference/), and [Amazon CloudWatch](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/AmazonCloudWatch/latest/DeveloperGuide/)\.
